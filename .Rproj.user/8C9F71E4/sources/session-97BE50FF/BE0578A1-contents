```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here are the packages required for this assignment:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(pacman)
```

## Data reading and composition

Read the data and rename them.

```{r}
OA <- read_csv("./data/OA_activitydat_20190302_BIOL3207.csv")
clark <- read_csv("./data/clark_paper_data.csv")
```

Summary statistics (mean, SD, N) were generated for the average activity of each fish species under each treatment.

```{r}
summary_data <-OA %>% group_by(species, treatment) %>%
              summarise(mean = mean(activity, na.rm = TRUE),
                        sd = sd(activity, na.rm = TRUE),
                        n = length(unique(animal_id))) %>%
              rename(Species = "species")

## Combine the data.

total_data <- cbind(clark, summary_data)
```

```{r}
final <- pivot_wider(total_data, names_from = treatment,
                     names_glue = "{treatment}_{.value}",
                     values_from = c("mean", "sd", "n"))

ocean <- read_csv("./data/ocean_meta_data.csv")

## Displays column and column information for the data.

dim(ocean)
dim(final)
```

```{r}
## Do some renaming of colnames so they match ocean
final_1 <- final %>% rename("oa.mean" = CO2_mean,
                            "oa.sd" = CO2_sd,
                            "oa.n" = CO2_n,
                            "ctrl.mean" = control_mean,
                            "ctrl.sd" = control_sd,
                            "ctrl.n" = control_n)

# Reorder col names based on names in ocean
final_1 <- final_1[names(ocean)]

# Check columns are in same order
colnames(ocean) == colnames(final_1)

# Combine the data
full_data <- rbind(ocean, final_1)
```
